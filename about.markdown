Hi, I'm Nate Anderson. 

I'm a web-developer originally from Kaneohe, Hawaii. I live in Englewood, Colorado with my husband.

I graduated from the USC where I studied Interactive Media and Accounting. These days I'm interested in data visualization and data science.

Here at bitmask I'll post about things like:
 - data journalism
 - code experiments
 - learning aids
 - pics of my dogs
 - movies, recipes, etc
