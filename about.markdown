![Nate Anderson personal pic](/assets/images/headshot/nate.jpg "Nate Anderson personal pic")


Hi, I'm Nate Anderson (full name Nathaniel Muir Anderson). 

I'm a web-developer originally from Kāneʻohe, Hawaiʻi. I live in Englewood, Colorado with my husband, 2 dogs, and 1 cat.

I graduated from USC where I studied Interactive Media and Accounting. These days I'm interested in making fun apps and interesting projects (especially data visualization).

Here at bitmask I'll post about things like:
 - data journalism
 - code experiments
 - learning aids
 - pics of my dogs
 - movies, recipes, etc

I hope bitmask does better than my last few tries:
 - Nate's XBRL site
  - an [inactive Google App Engine app](http://xbrlnexus.appspot.com/) where I started learning web dev and planned to build a suite of XBRL tools
 - [Nate's XBRL Blog](http://xbrlnexus.wordpress.co/)
  - a wordpress blog with the same kind of posts I plan to put here (coding, data-viz, personal interests, etc)
