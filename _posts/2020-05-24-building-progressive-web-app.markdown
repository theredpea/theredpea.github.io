I've always been a loud person, and my son's callouts during quarantine are also loud and frequent. To learn more about volume and intensity, I tried to build a Progressive Web App (PWA)
<!--more-->

# Device: Chromebook
The app should work on a Chromebook. My son uses one; Englewood and Denver public school systems arranged for kids to pickup Chromebooks during COVID-19 quarantine. I thought I woudl be building a "Chrome Extension" or building an app for "ChromeOS" -- I guess this would be a "Chrome App". However, [Chrome apps/extensions are deprecated](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/moving-forward-from-chrome-apps.html) and the [migration guide suggests PWA's instead](https://developers.chrome.com/apps/migration)
