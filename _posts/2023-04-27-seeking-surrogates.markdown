My husband and I are in the middle of a very exciting journey to have a kid! 👨‍👨‍👧
We made an embryo together with my sister and  now we're looking for a surrogate to help us through the rest of the journey...

Do you know anyone who could help us?  There *are some prerequisites* to being a surrogate, (including at least one prior pregnancy.)  The surrogate *doesn't need to be in Colorado* (but there are *surrogacy-friendly states*). 


[Email me](mailto:nate.muir.anderson@gmail.com) or visit our surrogacy agency's website: [Simple Surrogacy](https://www.simplesurrogacy.com/) to learn more:
