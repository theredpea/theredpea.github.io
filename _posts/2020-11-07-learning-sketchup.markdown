Some resources for learning [Sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com/), the 3D modeling software available for free online, to model the landscaping job.

 ## Day One
 Learning the basics

 - [SketchUp Quick Reference Card (includes keyboard shortcuts)](https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://www.sketchup.com/qrc/su/2019/en/win)
 - [Self-paced tutorials in the 3D Warehouse (`*.skp` files)](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/collection/36e1fa0d054a15eecc725c514c21d975/Self-paced-Tutorials)
 - [SketchUp YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SketchUpVideo)
  - [How to move a point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=129&v=XEHcjBRc9Oo&feature=emb_logo)

## Day Two
I built a rough model of the house
Mostly played around using what I learned in Day One.
I also associated my model with the physical location;
This was important so I could use shadows; so I could see how well the front porch shaded you from the sun , any day of the year, any time of day.
Shadows are a standout feature for me; they make my model look more realistic -- but more importantly, they let me design changes in the front yard to make it more livable (Colorado can be very sunny and very windy)

## Day Three
I took measurements of a few parts of the house and the front yard so I could build an accurate model

  ### Creating a Group
  - So I could shift different parts of the house without unintentionally moving "attached"/"connected" pieces; i.e. a sidewalk
  - [Create groups to prevent geometry "attaching"](https://forums.sketchup.com/t/why-are-my-objects-getting-attached-to-each-other/11661)
  - On [Groups vs Components](http://www.thesketchupessentials.com/sketchup-groups-components-basics/)

  ### Labeling 
  - So I could add dimensions in every spot I took measurements; after I added dimensions in Sketchup, I could throw away my handwritten measurement scratchpaper.

  - [Add labels and annotations](https://help.sketchup.com/en/layout/labeling-items-your-document)

  ### Importing Images
   - So I could take a screenshot of the house in Google Map Satellite view, and use the screenshot as an image/architecture reference
   - [Import an image](https://help.sketchup.com/en/sketchup/tracing-image) 



## Interesting Links

 - [Sketchup "Pre-design"](https://forums.sketchup.com/t/design-research-get-it-right-with-predesign/142661) provides a "concise overview of the seasons, sky conditions, and predominant winds"
   - After using the shadow feature, I think Pre-design sounds great!
